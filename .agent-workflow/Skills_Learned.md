Keep max ~15 bullets. Delete stale.

Rules that pay rent
- If Low Risk + conf>0.95: Intent → do → quick check → log (no questions).
- If stuck after 2 patches: stop; reclassify harness/spec/repro (SOP-005).
- Contract-first prevents integration mismatches: keep `scratchpad.md` signed.
- Prefer 1 failing test cmd; avoid full-suite spam.
- Progress.txt is toxic to context: archive+prune each slice.
- UI “tests pass but broken”: require at least 1 Playwright smoke screenshot/trace for critical flows.
