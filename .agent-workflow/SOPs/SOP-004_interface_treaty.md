# SOP-004 Interface Treaty  <!-- Sisyphus Audit: Integration Hell -->

Before Implementer + Test Engineer split:
- co-author `.agent-workflow/scratchpad.md`
- lock exact interface contract:
  - function signatures
  - payload types / schemas
  - error shapes
  - sample I/O
- sign: `SIGNED: implementer, tester`
No implementation before SIGNED.
